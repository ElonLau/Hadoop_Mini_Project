# Hadoop_Mini_Project

In this project, you will utilize data from an automobile tracking platform that tracks the history of
important incidents after the initial sale of a new vehicle. Such incidents include subsequent
private sales, repairs, and accident reports. The platform provides a good reference for
second-hand buyers to understand the vehicles they are interested in.
In this project, you will receive a dataset with a history report of various vehicles. Your goal is to
write a MapReduce program to produce a report of the total number of accidents per make and
year of the car.
